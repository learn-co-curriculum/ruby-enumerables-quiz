# Enumerator Coding Challenge

## Objectives

Become familiar with using common iterators introduced in the previous lesson.


%%%

### Code Challenge I: Using `.each`

Let's try out the enumerator methods we just learned. Refer back to the previous lesson to help you pass this challenge. 


Below, we have a variable, `lunch_menu`, set equal to an array of lunch menu items.

Since you're super hungry and super excited about lunch, use the `.each` method to enumerate over the array and append an `"!"` ("exclamation mark") to each menu item. You can use the `<<` ("shovel operator") on each menu item string to add an `"!"` like this: `"pizza" << "!"`.

~~~ruby 

lunch_menu = ["pizza", "sandwhich", "sushi", "soup", "salad"]

#code your solution using .each here

~~~solution

lunch_menu.each do |lunch_item|
	lunch_item << "!"
end

~~~validation

assert_equal(response, ["pizza!", "sandwhich!", "sushi!", "soup!", "salad!"])

### Code Challenge II: Using `.collect`

Below we have a variable, `nums`, set equal to an array of numbers. Enumerate over the array with the `.collect` method and return a new array of the squares of those numbers. 

~~~ruby

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]

#code you solution using .collect here

~~~solution 

nums.collect do |num|
	num * num
end

~~~validation

assert_equal(response, [1, 4, 9, 16])

~~~

### Code Challenge III: Using `.select`

Below we have a variable, `odds_and_evens`, set equal to an array of numbers. Use the `.select` enumerator to iterate over the array and return any even numbers. This requires checking if a number is even. If you're unsure how to do that, reference the Ruby Documentation or try a google search!

~~~ruby

odds_and_evens = [1, 3, 2, 18, 5, 10, 24]

#code your solution using .select here

~~~solution

odds_and_evens.select do |num|
	num.even?
end

~~~validation

assert_equal(response, [2, 18, 10, 24])

~~~

### Code Challenge IV: Using `.find`

Below we once again have a variable, `odds_and_evens`, set equal to an array of numbers. This time, use the `.find` method to iterate over the array and return only the *first* array element that is *odd*. 

~~~ruby

odds_and_evens = [1, 3, 2, 18, 5, 10, 24]

#code your solution using .find here

~~~solution

odds_and_evens.find do |num|
	num.odd?
end

~~~validation

assert_equal(response, 1)

### Code Challenge V: Using `delete_if`

Below we have a variable, `cats_and_dogs`, set equal to an array of strings that are either a `"cat"` or a  `"dog"`. We all know that cats and dogs don't get along. Iterate over the array and delete the elements that represent dogs. 

~~~ruby

cats_and_dogs = ["cat", "cat", "dog", "cat", "dog", "dog"]

#code your solution using .delete_if 

~~~solution

cats_and_dogs.delete_if do |pet|
	pet == "dog"
end

~~~validation

assert_equal(response, ["cat", "cat", "cat"])

~~~

### Code Challenge VI: Using `include?`

Below we have a variable, `famous_cats`, set equal to an array of famous cats. Use the `.include?` method to check and see if the array includes the string `"Maru"`. 

~~~ruby

famous_cats = ["Maru", "Lil Bub", "Grumpy Cat"]

#code your solution using .include? here

~~~solution

famous_cats.include?("Maru")

~~~validation

assert_equal(response, true)

~~~

### Code Challenge VII: Using `any?`

Below we have a variable, `quiet_and_loud`, that is set equal to an array of strings. Use the `.any?` method to iterate over the array to determine if any of the words contained there are loud (upcased). 

~~~ruby

quiet_and_loud = ["hi", "HI", "shhh", "WHAT?!"]

#code your solution using .any? here

~~~solution 

quiet_and_loud.any? do |word|
	word == word.upcase
end

~~~validation

assert_equal(response, true)
